PNC Ground Shifts to the Side of the Subject ‚Äì Kant IV-a

I made a mistake concerning Kant‚Äôs doctrines on logic. Relying on a smaller pool of Kant material in English, Peikoff 1964 had also made this mistake.

I asked of Kant in the Prep thread (2009 paper) as well as in this Dissertation thread: How can logic be rules necessary for correct operation of the understanding and reason if they simply are rules given by the understanding and reason, and they are rules descriptive and necessarily operative in all understanding and reason? ‚ÄúI concur with the conclusion of Peikoff and others he cites that once Kant had the constitution of the subject the sole source of the purely formal and purely a priori, he was not able to stably maintain an absolute necessity of PNC and other principles of logic together with their normativity, which latter entails our ability to not adhere to such principles. I add that this same irresolvable mess arises for every other sort of cognition purely formal and purely a priori, whether analytic or synthetic, once Kant has squarely located their source purely in the constitution of mind, in its fundamental dynamics, not at all in the constitution of the world.‚Äù (Kant III)

The world according to Kant‚Äîthe empirical and the mathematical‚Äîcannot be found with structure contrary to the formal structure of logic provided by human mind. The source of form had moved indoors. Conformance of the world to logic is assured in Kant‚Äôs scheme; there is absolute rightness of PNC (and its cohort, identity) for the world we take up, even though PNC is ultimately sourced in pure mind. Objects of any sort can be given to us as objects only upon actuation of our conceptual, logical faculties. The portion of mind trying to discern the world beyond the world‚Äôs bare, mind-given logical form is able to commit contradictions, within Kant‚Äôs scheme. The pure understanding gives some laws, but the impure understanding may fail to always conform to them in its pursuit of specific empirical and mathematical knowledge.

We can still fault Kant in his view that we possess any ‚Äúpure a priori‚Äù knowledge of any thing at all, in Kant‚Äôs radical senses of the a priori and the pure; we can deny that PNC or any other formal principle is such knowledge as that (on purity, see Chance 2018). But it is not the case that Kant‚Äôs scheme falters over the fact that humans make logical errors. (Notice Kant‚Äôs stress on human logical fallibility in lectures already from the early 1770‚Äôs; Lu-Adler 2018, 108.)

Peikoff quotes from the Abbott translation (1885) of the Introduction of Kant‚Äôs Logic (the J√§sche Logicüòû ‚ÄúHow error is possible, since in the formal sense of the word, that is, how a form of thought inconsistent with the understanding is possible; this is hard to comprehend; as indeed in general we cannot comprehend how any faculty can deviate from its own essential laws‚Äù (44). But Peikoff and I failed to notice or anyway failed to address J√§sche‚Äôs words, reflecting Kant‚Äôs notes for his logic lectures, on how this problem is to be resolved (here staying with the Abbott translation): ‚ÄúBesides the understanding there is in us another indispensable source of knowledge. This is the sensibility, which supplies the material for thought, and besides works according to different laws from the understanding. From the senses, however, considered in and by itself, error cannot arise, since the senses do not judge. / Hence the origin of all error must be sought solely in the unobserved influence of the sensibility on the understanding, or, to speak more exactly, on the judgment. It is owing to this influence that in our judgements we mistake merely subjective reasons for objective, and consequently confound the mere semblance of truth with truth itself.‚Äù (ibid.)

Thinkers following on the heels of Kant then need not ‚Äúreturn to an ontological interpretation of logic, thereby preserving absolutism in logic by founding it on facts of reality independent of the variable workings of human minds‚Äù else plunk for conventional choice of logical rules such as PNC, the fork proposed in Peikoff 1964. For instance Robert Hanna‚Äôs 2006 neo-Kantian, subject-sided, anti-conventionalist account of the nature of formal logic crafts a third way.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Peikoff‚Äôs reliance on Henry Mansel‚Äôs infirm understanding and adulterated representation of Kant was unfortunate. I refer specifically to Mansel‚Äôs Prolegomena Logica: An Inquiry into the Psychological Character of Logical Processes (1860). Mansel insists an empirical psychology must be put to work to ‚Äúvindicate‚Äù logic. Mansel and others Mansel cites who took this post-Kantian turn were trying to keep a foot in the school of Kant (and touting themselves as significantly Kantian) while kicking that foot with the other, empiricist, Kant-undone foot. ‚ÄúTo Psychlogy we must look for the explanation and justification of the peculiar features of Logic‚Äù (1860, 6). Not by the lights of Kant! For Kant all successful reasoning and understanding requires formal logic as a necessary presumed norm; psychology cannot attain and justify psychology‚Äôs special knowledge without thoroughly conforming itself to the general norms of formal logic, which are already presumed (further, Hatfield 1990).

When Kant was four years old, Christian Wolff was writing: ‚ÄúIn order to demonstrate the rules of logic, principles must be taken from ontology. Furthermore, . . . we must learn from psychology what the cognitive faculty is and what its operations are. Hence it is also clear that, in order to demonstrate the rules of logic, principles must be taken from psychology. . . . Therefore, ontology and psychology should precede logic if everything in logic is to be rigorously demonstrated and if its rules are to be genuinely known.‚Äù (quoted in Lu-Adler 2018, 92)

In Wolff‚Äôs view, we have a natural aptitude to follow the prescriptions that are the principles of logic, but to cultivate that aptitude into a habit of their correct use requires learning explicitly what those rules are. The correct logical rules having become explicit are to be followed for knowledge in general, and they are discernible as the correct rules by their enablement of the complete demonstrations in mathematics, particularly in geometry (Lu-Adler 2018, 90‚Äì97).

Kant took under consideration the ancient and medieval views on logic as well as moderns such as F. Bacon, Locke, Leibniz, Wolff, and of course Baumgarten and Meier (Wolffian variants). Meier followed Wolff in taking logic-as-a-science (what Kant would later call pure general logic) to be based in part on principles of psychology. Kant was rejecting this already in the pre-Critical period of the Bloomberg logic lecture notes from the early 1770‚Äôs (Lu-Adler 2018, 110‚Äì11).

Kant regarded pure general logic as a science in his strong sense of science, in which the object of the science is treated ‚Äúwholly according to a priori principles‚Äù (1786, 4:468). A science is termed proper science by Kant if it not treated only according to laws of experience and has more than mere empirical certainty. Proper science has apodictic certainty. Science more generally is ‚Äúa system, that is, a whole of cognition ordered according to principles,‚Äù and ‚Äúsuch principles may be either principles of empirical or of rational connection of cognitions into a whole‚Äù (4:467). In proper science, the connecting principles are not empirical, but the rational connection of ground to consequence. The empirical connections in chemistry do not possess the necessity that yields apodictic certainty, according to Kant. Proper science of nature has only as much apodictic certainty as there is in it a priori knowledge and application of mathematics. Empirical psychology is even farther from being a proper natural science than chemistry (4:469‚Äì71).

‚ÄúA rational doctrine of nature . . . deserves the name of a natural science, only in case the fundamental natural laws therein are cognized a priori, and are not mere laws of experience. One calls a cognition of nature of the first kind pure, but that of the second kind is called applied rational cognition‚Äù (4:468, my underscore). That distinction under the terms pure and applied resembles the distinction under those same terms in Kant‚Äôs treatment of logic, although the two sorts of laws of nature, unlike principles of logic, are not norms.

To be continued.
