PNC Ground Shifts to the Side of the Subject – Kant IV-c

Let’s test that analogy Kant floated (see last quotes from KrV in this post) between his distinction Pure Logic v. Applied Logic and his distinction Pure Morality v. Proper Virtue. Among the things he writes concerning the latter distinction are the following.

“[Moral laws] hold as laws only insofar as they can be seen to have an a priori basis and be necessary” (1797 6:215). Kant does not here mean necessary as in necessary for some purpose, though such laws are required for some purpose; he means just plain necessary as when we say something is necessarily so. By the proposed analogy, we have: Pure general logical laws hold only insofar as they can be seen to have an a priori basis and be necessary. 

By its moral laws, “reason commands how we are to act even though no example of this could be found, and it takes no account of the advantages we thereby gain, which only experience could teach us. For although reason allows us to seek our advantage in every way possible to us . . . still the authority of its precepts as commands is not based on these considerations. Instead it uses them (as counsels) only as a counterweight against inducements to the contrary, to offset in advance the error of biased scales in practical appraisal [for what best to do], and only then to insure that the weight of practical reason’s a priori grounds will turn the scales in favor of the authority of its precepts.” (1797 6:216)

Rather like F. Bacon and Locke, Kant thought of errors we make in applied logic as largely from prejudices (Jäsche 1800, §§75–81; Lu-Adler 2018, 67, 102, 114), and this tunes pretty well with the role of prejudice for advantage that Kant sees in the origin of moral errors. Learning applied logic—which like pure logic, applies to any topic whatever—can free one from prejudices that come onto the scene in the workings of empirical psychology as logic is put to concrete occasions of thinking. Transcendence of prejudices in the arena of applied logic frees one to think for oneself (Lu-Adler 2018, 114). All analogies break down in some ways, but I take seriously for Kant’s account of logic the conception of commanding by principles from pure logic as analogous with commanding by pure morality.

Kant characterized pure general logic as well as pure morality as objective, in contrast to subjectivity in the arena of applied general logic and in the arena of proper virtue. In pure morality, there is found a necessary law for all rational beings connected a priori with the concept of a rational will as such.

  Quote
The subjective ground of desire is an incentive; the objective ground of volition is a motive; hence the distinction between subjective ends, which rest on incentives, and objective ends, which depend on motives, which hold for every rational being. Practical principles [moral principles] are formal if they abstract from all subjective ends, whereas they are material if they have put these, and consequently certain incentives, as their base. The ends that a rational being proposes at his discretion . . . (material ends) are all only relative; for only their mere relation to a specifically constituted faculty of desire on the part of the subject gives them their worth, which can therefore furnish no universal principles, no principles valid and necessary for all rational beings and also for every volition . . . Hence all these relative ends are only the ground of hypothetical imperatives.

But suppose there were something the existence of which in itself has an absolute worth, something which as an end in itself could be a ground of determinate laws . . . .

Now I say that the human being and in general every rational being exists as an end in itself, not merely as a means to be used by this or that will at its discretion; instead he must in all his actions, whether directed to himself or also to other rational beings, always be regarded at the same time as an end. . . . Rational beings are called persons because their nature already marks them out as an end in itself, that is, as something that may not be used merely as a means, and so far limits all choice (and is an object of respect). These, therefore, are not merely subjective ends, the existence of which as an effect of our action has a worth for us, but rather objective ends, that is, beings the existence of which is in itself an end . . . .

The human being necessarily represents his own existence in this way; so far it is thus a subjective principle of human actions. But every other rational being also represents his existence in this way consequent on just the same rational ground that also holds for me; thus it is at the same time an objective principle from which, as a supreme practical [moral] ground, it must be possible to derive all laws of the will. (Kant 1785, 4:427–29; also 1788, 5:86–88)

Kant does not apply the sort of argument in that last paragraph to support his contention that pure general logic is objective. Kant uses objective in various senses. He does not reach the sense of objectivity to be recognized in pure general logic by recognizing merely that this logic is common to all agents of human cognition. Indeed, applied logic and the errors it diagnoses and remedies are also at hand in all such agents. Applied logic is subjective, in one of Kant’s senses of the term, simply because it treats not purely a priori, necessary norms for how we ought to think, but partly how we actually think. In my estimate, however, Kant’s contention that principles of pure logic have normative character at all is nothing known independently of concrete operations of thought. 

It was not  unreasonable to consider a prior, necessary logical norms as objective, but I submit that their objective character we discern comes not at all from their purportedly a priori normative element, from their character as “commanding,” but from the a priori standing and necessity in the formal structures of logic, as in those two features of the formal structures of pure mathematics. They are objective in the sense that you cannot get around them. They are stubborn, as Whitehead would say. Pure geometry of Kant’s era, preeminently Euclid’s geometry, provides norms for all sorts of practical constructions and discernments, but normative import of pure geometry is incidental to it.

In contrast to the character of pure geometry, normative character, in the view of Kant, is essential to pure general logic and, as well, to applied general logic. The distinction Kant drew under those titles of general logic do not hold so sharply as he had thought in his general pronouncements about the distinction. He drew other sorts of divisions of what may reasonably be called logic, but this particular distinction is a failure. In his lectures on logic, Kant would count the prescriptions that we now call formal fallacies of inference as belonging to pure general logic, for they are norms purely of form, and they treat no psychological impediments; the informal fallacies of inference would be glossed as applied general logic, for they concern partly how we actually think, not only how we ought to think, and they deal with contingent, psychological impediments. 

Among logical prescriptions for concepts, Kant has rules for definitions of concepts. Examples would be that (i) species must parse the members under the concept such that each member belongs exclusively under one of the concept’s species or another and (ii) definitions should be in terms of internal characteristics of things under the concept being defined. These rules are guides at work unconsciously in untutored concrete reason, according to Kant’s lectures, and logic only makes them abstract, explicit formulas. The standing Kant conceived for the logical rules of judgment and rules of inference is quite different from the standing he gives to those logical rules for concepts. All these rules of general logic are for perfection of cognition as to form, but the premier rules for judgments and inferences are as commands coming externally to concrete operations of reason, tutored or untutored. It will be noticed that a definition of a concept is a judgment, so theory of the perfection of concepts as to form is brought to completion by logical rules for judgments. This entire scheme of externality and command-character with respect to concrete judgment and deduction is a forced contrivance, not, I say, a sound characterization of logic that is in our elementary texts and in Kant’s own logic lectures.

“The proposition, No thing can have a predicate that contradicts it, is called the principle of contradiction” (A151 B190). Kant rightly held that the premier fundamental principle of formal rightness in judgments is the principle of (non)contradiction (further, Pluhar 1987, lxxxixn90). He rightly held that the fundamental principle in deductive inference is not PNC, but this: whatever holds of the genus or species holds also of all things under the genus or species (Kant 1762, §2; 1792, 773; cf. Peikoff 1964, 134–35*).

“A judgment is the way that concepts belong to one consciousness universally, objectively” (Kant c.1780, 928). To say “God is moral and is not moral” is a contradiction. Is avoidance of such perfectly plain error of contradiction the great command from pure general logic concerning judgments? I hardly think so. What I see Kant wielding in his logic lectures is the likes of “God is moral and evil is not punished.” That is what was traditionally called contradictio in adjecto. In the example, one is forgetting the elementary traits of God and contradicts that concept of God in contending that evil is not punished. I want to stress that not forgetting elementary aspects of what one is talking about is touching on contingent, empirical psychological processes and hardly a purely a priori rule.

In the next installment, I intend to end the long study that is this thread. So we’ll end with the finish of these Kant issues, and I’ll not then be doubling back for more on conventionalist theories of logic. In that next, final installment, I’ll show the untenability of Kant’s sharp divide of pure general logic and applied general logic as it pertains to deductive inference and the failure of Kant’s attempted escape from the criticism (e.g. from Peikoff 1964) that Kant cannot have both his way of norm-setting by general logic yet its necessity of law straightly descriptive of human thought (as Kant appeared to maintain, on the plain face of it, in the Jäsche Logic [and in the Wiener Logic, unavailable for Peikoff 1964]).
